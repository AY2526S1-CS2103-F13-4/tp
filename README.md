### Neighbourly
This is a CS2103 Software Engineering (SE) project by students.
* For team details, refer to [About us](docs/AboutUs.md)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Neighbourly_).
* Motivation: Despite funding put into ageing initiatives, many seniors remain socially isolated at the margins of care. Outreach associates are responsible for tracking residents in their community, noting health needs and emergency contacts.
* Neighbourly provides a structured contact book that allows an associate to record seniors' details and manage caregiverâ€“elderly assignments.
* The codebase is written in OOP fashion.
* It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
